              <p>
                In my previous project, the reporting and dealing with scientific information skills I displayed were
                severely lacking. This project, I wanted to improve on these areas. The project being a research project
                made it the perfect opportunity to.
                <br> <br> I spent a lot of time this project doing background research, keeping good track of my
                sources, and writing my report throughout the project, instead of just at the end. Ultimately, I was
                very proud of what came out of it, even though the research I conducted turned out a bit non-conclusive
                due to a lack of data.
                <br> <br>The data I did have, I analyzed using SPSS statistics. This was the first time I conducted a
                statistical analysis, and I got to work on these skills so I could later use them again in my FMP, where
                I was dealing with a lot more data.
                <br> <br>The game I made this project stands out among the rest of my work, as it is the only
                non-educational game I have made. I wanted to broaden my horizon a little, and I really enjoyed trying
                to make a game that focuses primarily on being fun, working out little details to create a more fun
                experience, tweaking the mechanics of the game for a good look and feel. The research question I was
                trying to answer can actually be seen as a “little detail” like this.
                <br> <br>I was investigating a concept I came up with called “the illusion of non-linearity”. The idea
                was to combine an open world game, giving players autonomy over where they go, with loading levels
                linearly, giving level designers more control over the difficulty of the game.
                <br> <br>The difference between the two versions of the game was very small, but I hoped it would create
                a noticeable difference in the level of autonomy. It just shows how dedicated I am in creating the
                optimal experience.

                This project had two versions. One of the versions featured a linear game, where players had to
                collect keys at the end of each level, to open the gate to the next level. The other version included the
                “illusion of non-linearity”, in this version every level was accessible, but the first level entered
                would always load the first level, the second level entered would load the second level and so on.
                <br><br>Both versions are playable by downloading the game files.
              <p style="font-weight:bold ;">Download instructions:</p>
              The download button on this page will open a google drive folder feature 3 zip files. These zip files
              contain the game files. You can download whichever version of the game you want to try.
              <ul>
                <li>Illusion – featuring the illusion of non-linearity</li>
                <li>Linear – featuring linear levels</li>
                <li>Random – randomly picks one of the two when starting to play</li>
              </ul>
              Download the zip file and unzip it somewhere on your computer to play. Play by opening “game.exe”.
