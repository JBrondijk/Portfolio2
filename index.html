                            <p>
                                My name is Jurrien Brondijk, I graduated from my master Industrial Design back in 2022.
                                I love creating immsersive, interactive learning experiences. I like to think about how
                                my design contributes to the broader experience of the ecosystem it is placed in. I care
                                for every detail, no
                                matter how small, that might benefit the end user experience. I draw a lot of
                                inspiration from the videogames I enjoy. As a
                                player, I’m often blown away by little details developers add to make their worlds feel
                                alive. I love putting that
                                level of care into my designs as well.
                                <br><br>
                                I have been practicing design ever since I started high school. There, I followed a
                                track
                                called technasium, in which I did a number design projects similar to those I would
                                later do studying industrial design. This was my main motivation for going starting this
                                study, and to persue design going forward.
                                <br><br>Over the course of my studies, I developed not only my skills as a designer, but
                                more
                                importantly, I found my passion for creating interactive educational experiences. I saw
                                how my interests and hobbies could be combined with what I am doing professionally, when
                                during my bachelor
                                I combined my interest in gaming with my studies by designing educational videogames.
                                And again during my masters, where I took a new found interest in zoos, and combined it
                                with my studies by working on zoo education together with Safaripark Beekse Bergen.
                                <br><br>I want to continue to work on the kind of projects where I can let my passion
                                shine
                                through in my work.

                                I am very capable of translating my designs into a fully experiential prototype, giving
                                potential users
                                something tangible to give feedback on. Over the past years, I’ve created several
                                educational VR, AR and PC games.
                                Each in-depth experiences featuring fully-fledged environments, intuitive controls,
                                animated characters, visuals,
                                sound, gameplay elements, and learning goals. <br><br>I enjoy learning new skills I need
                                when
                                developing prototypes. I’m a
                                quick and eager learner, picking up many skills over the past years, like programming in
                                a variety of languages (HTML, Javascript, CSS, Angular, Java, C#, Unreal Engine),
                                drawing, 3D modeling, animating and video editing.

                                In my free time I like to play videogames, either immersing myself in another world or
                                playing a game that allows me to express my creativity. Over the past few years the game
                                I've been drawn to for the latter has been Planet Zoo, a game in which players are able
                                to create their own zoos, with incredible degrees of freedom.

                                <br><br>I've been usign the game
                                to create a scale model of a real zoo, Safaripark Beekse Bergen, but I also make my own
                                zoos and try to learn as much about zoo design as I can. I find this a lot of fun, and I
                                love to go outside and visit real zoos to take inspiration from. I make YouTube videos
                                about both my own virtual zoos, as well as the real life zoos I visit in the hope to
                                inspire other players.

                                <p>After the VR language learning project, I wanted to further develop my programming
                                    skills. I interned at Enversed Studios, a company making a variety of virtual
                                    reality experiences, for both education as well as entertaiment. One of the main
                                    projects I worked on was a VR fire safaty training tool.</p>

                                <p>This was the graduation project of my bachelor. I designed a virtual reality
                                    experience in which the player had to care for a virtual pet. The pet would display
                                    certain emotions based on how it was treated. The goal was for kids to train their
                                    emotion recognition skills.</p>

                                <p>In this design project I helped design an augmented reality game that introduced kids
                                    to the English language in a playful way. They could use word cards to complete
                                    sentences which would then be played out in AR.</p>

                                    of a linear one, to see if this had an effect on players' enjoyment of the game.</p>

                                <p>Planet Zoo is a videogame in which players can create their own Zoos. I have started
                                    to use this game to make a scale model of my favorite zoo, Safaripark Beekse Bergen,
                                    in great detail. I also use the game to design my own zoos, and make videos about it
                                    on YouTube.</p>
